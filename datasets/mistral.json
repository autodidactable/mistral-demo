    "expected": "Cleopatra VII, the last active ruler of the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt, had a profound impact on Egyptian history through her political acumen and cultural influence. [pause_350ms] She is best known for her alliances with powerful Roman leaders, such as Julius Caesar and Mark Antony, which aimed to secure Egypt's independence and prosperity during a tumultuous period. [pause_350ms] Cleopatra's reign marked the end of the Hellenistic era and the beginning of Roman dominance in Egypt. [pause_350ms] As her defeat alongside Antony led to the annexation of Egypt by Rome in 30 BCE. [pause_350ms] Additionally, she is remembered for her efforts to revive Egyptian culture and religion, blending Greek and Egyptian traditions, which left a lasting legacy on the region's identity.

    "input": "Why is the moon round?",
    "expected": "The moon is round due to the force of gravity. [pause_350ms] When a celestial body like the moon has enough mass, gravity pulls its material toward the center, creating a shape that minimizes gravitational potential energy. [pause_350ms] This results in a nearly spherical shape, as a sphere is the most efficient form for distributing mass evenly around a center point. [pause_350ms] Additionally, the moon's round shape has been maintained over billions of years, despite some minor irregularities on its surface.",

    "expected": "The water cycle is like nature's way of recycling water. [pause_350ms] It starts when the sun heats up water in rivers, lakes, and oceans, turning it into vapor, which is like invisible steam. [pause_350ms] This vapor rises into the sky and cools down, forming clouds. [pause_350ms] When the clouds get heavy, they release the water as rain or snow, which falls back to the ground. [pause_350ms] Then, the water collects in rivers, lakes, and oceans, and the whole process starts again. [pause_350ms] It's a never-ending cycle that helps keep our planet healthy and full of life.",
